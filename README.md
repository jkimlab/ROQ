### ROQ
----------------
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has advanced genomic research, highlighting the need for accurate read alignment metrics. The Read Overlapping Quality (ROQ) score is a novel machine-learning-based metric that predicts the overlap between a readâ€™s true origin and its mapped position. Unlike conventional metrics, ROQ better reflects true read origins, even in complex genomic regions, enhancing downstream analyses by reducing misalignment and improving read quality assessment.
